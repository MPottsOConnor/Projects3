# F# Parallel Processing times
This F# program tests the runtime of an algorithm (max cost) accross a matrix of varying sizes using different types of functions (parallel, non-parallel and actor based)

1. Run the a1.bat file
2. You will continually be asked to press a key after each file is run through the algorithm
3. You will see the program run through the .txt files and determine the processing times of the following functions:
- Sequential
- Parallel naive
- Parallel with specified partition range
- Actor based processing

NOTE: On the first 'key' prompt, the program will state that not all arguments are implemented. Following this however, the program will properly 
run whenever you kit a key.

I am responsible for a1.fs only.
